# Ball and Beam Control System

**Project:** Ball and Beam using Fuzzy Logic  
May 2024

## Overview
Designed and implemented a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for a Ball and Beam system to achieve real-time position and stability control. The project involved iterative tuning of membership functions to optimize system response and minimize overshoot.

## Objectives
- Implement precise control of ball position on a beam.
- Minimize overshoot and stabilize the system in real time.
- Demonstrate control algorithm performance using MATLAB/Simulink.

## Key Features
- Developed Fuzzy Logic Controller using MATLAB/Simulink.
- Iterative tuning for optimized system response.
- Real-time simulation of control performance.
- Integration with sensors and actuators (simulated environment).

## Project Files
