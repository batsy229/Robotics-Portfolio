# Automated Amazon Warehouse Package Identification and Packaging

**Date:** May 2024  

## Project Overview
This project focused on designing and implementing an automated warehouse system for picking and placing packages using robotic manipulators. The system is capable of identifying and tracking moving packages on a TurtleBot platform, simulating real-world warehouse operations.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Pick-and-Place:** Detects objects and moves them onto/off the moving TurtleBot.  
- **Semantic RGB-D Segmentation:** Identifies packages in real-time using depth and color information.  
- **Continuous Tracking:** Updates object positions continuously to handle dynamic, moving items.  
- **ROS Integration:** Coordinated motion planning and trajectory control using ROS for multi-robot operations.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++  
- **Robotics Frameworks:** ROS, MoveIt!  
- **Perception:** RGB-D Cameras, YOLOv8 semantic segmentation  
- **Hardware:** UR3 robotic arm, TurtleBot, depth cameras  

## Project Outcomes
- Achieved real-time detection and manipulation of moving objects.  
- Demonstrated robust pick-and-place operations in a dynamic environment.  
- Developed end-to-end control and perception pipeline for multi-robot warehouse simulation.
